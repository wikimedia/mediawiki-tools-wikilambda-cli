# Wikilambda CLI

A command line interface to Wikifunctions (or any other WikiLambda
installation).

wikilambda is usable as a CLI tool in two ways: either calling it for a specific
command or in interactive mode.

## installation

Clone the lambda CLI and set up the dependencies:
```
git clone ssh://gerrit.wikimedia.org:29418/mediawiki/tools/wikilambda-cli
cd wikilambda-cli
git submodule init
git submodule update
npm install
```

## Batch

The command line works in the following way:

```src/lambda.js <parameters> <input>```

Examples:

```
lambda --label --language Z1004 Z4
lambda --normal '"Hello"'
lambda --canonical '{ "Z1K1": "Z6", "Z6K1": "Hello" }'
lambda --evaluate 'and(true, false)'
lambda --noevaluate 'head(string to list("abc"))'
```

The input may need to be escaped from the shell, e.g. if it includes
parentheses or quotes or other special character.

The following parameters are available:
--[no]tokens: shows the results of the tokenizer
--[no]delabel: shows the results of the delabeler
--[no]ast: shows the results of the parser
--[no]eval[uate]: performs an evaluation or not. The evaluation is
  done on the wiki, not locally
--[no]raw: displays the raw result from the evaluation call
--[no]normal: normalizes the result
--[no]canonical: canonicalizes the result
--[no]prettyprint: prints the result in the format used in the data directory
--[no]label: replaces all ZIDs with labels
--[no]format: uses a formatter to show the result in an easier to read way
--[no]template: interpret the input as an NLG template
--[no]timer: displays how much time the call took
--file: followed by a path to a file to be loaded by the tool
--config: followed by a path to a config file (see below)
--language: followed by the language to use. Can be a ZID or a language code
--wiki: URL to a wiki, or a path to a local directory
--cache: path to a local directory

The input can be given in the following ways:
- in JSON: whenever it starts with ", {, or [
- as a ZID, and then it will be loaded from the configured wiki or local path
- in functional syntax, i.e. the name of a type or function, followed by
  comma-separated arguments in parentheses

## Interactive

You can call the interactive mode by starting lambda without input data.
You can use the parameters given above, and they overwrite whatever is in
the config file, e.g.

```src/lambda.js --language en```

The command line interface per default runs:
- the standard parser. If parsing fails, respective errors are displayed and
  we stop.
- full validation. If validation fails, respective errors are displayed and
  we stop.
- evaluation, if it is a function call.
- the writer on what we received so far.

In the standard setting, you can start typing.
If you start with a {, " or [, the interactive shell assumes that you are
entering a JSON file.
If you type in the label or ZID of an existing ZObject that object will be
displayed.
If you type in a function name or a type followed by a the values for the
keys in a comma separated list enclosed in (), this will be understood as
a function call or an instance construction.

The interactive shell has the following magic features:
- you can go up and down in a history, also across sessions
- you can type a . and then use any of the following commands
- .help: List all commands
- .break: Sometimes you get stuck, this gets you out
- .clear: Break, and also clear the local context
- .editor: Enter editor mode
- .exit: Exit the REPL
- .load: Load a local file as if you were inputting it
- .save: Save all evaluated commands in this REPL session to a file
- .version: Version number of the lambda CLI
- .language: show or set the natural language
- .tokens: tokenizes the input
- .delabel: turns the input labels into ZIDs
- .ast: shows the parsed call
- .evaluate: switches the evaluator on or off
- .raw: displays the raw result from the evaluator
- .normal: shows the normalizad version
- .canonical: shows the canonicalized version
- .prettyprint: return the exact format as used for the data directory in
  the WikiLambda repository
- .labelize: use a writer that shows the canonical version but labelized
- .timer: switch the timer on or off
- .wiki: URL of the wiki, or a local path to the data
- .label: if a ZID, returns the label, if a label, returns all matching ZIDs
  with their types.
- .reload: reloads a specific ZID. Without arguments, deletes all cache.

Many of the commands take either an argument or, if none is given, assume
the result from the previous command as the argument.

## Configuration

The config.json file allows to configure all the settings given above.
- language: natural language
- parser
- writer
- wiki: where to load the data from (a local directory or via http)
- which evaluator to run (local one or via http)
- cache: local file with cache

The values of the configuration parameters are either a single value, or a map
from a short name to a value. In case of the latter, the first value is taken
as the default value.

The following configuration keys are just booleans, either true or false.
- tokens: shows the results of the tokenizer
- delabel: shows the results of the delabeler
- ast: shows the results of the parser
- evaluate: performs an evaluation or not. The evaluation is
  done on the wiki, not locally
- raw: displays the raw result from the evaluation call
- normal: normalizes the result
- canonical: canonicalizes the result
- prettyprint: prints the result in the format used in the data directory
- label: replaces all ZIDs with labels
- format: uses a formatter to show the result in an easier to read way
- timer: displays how much time the call took

The configuration can be overriden through command line arguments which have
the same name but are prefixed by a -- and preceded by a "no" if meant
to be switched off.

lambda --labelize --language Z1002 --timer Z4

The plans of what this tool should be able to do is described in
